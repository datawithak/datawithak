# Hi, I'm Anukriti 👋

CS undergrad + MBA. I work at the intersection of **Technical Product and Strategy** and I build things on the side that simplify my life. Every app and tool here is something I actually use daily.

Based in **New York City**.

### What I'm building

| Project | What it does | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| [**mamas-kb**](https://github.com/datawithak/mamas-kb) · [live ↗](https://mamas-kb-psf8.vercel.app/) | Mom groups are a wealth of hyper-local knowledge but it's buried in thousands of messages. I extracted the knowledge from multiple WhatsApp groups into a searchable site, with no names or media exposed: just the information. | Next.js · TypeScript · Python · Claude AI |
| [**subwayping**](https://github.com/datawithak/subwayping) | You're out with friends, keep pulling out your phone to check the subway, and miss your train anyway. Worse: you end up on Instagram, check work emails, and kill the buzz. SubwayPing is a home screen widget: one red button, and you get notified about your train. Phone stays in your pocket. | Kotlin · Android |
| [**keepmehonest-pantry**](https://github.com/datawithak/keepmehonest-pantry) | My husband has a talent for not finding things in the pantry and buying duplicates, so we end up with 3 jars of pasta sauce and one expires before we get to it. Wasted food, money, and space (fellow New Yorkers know). A shared app where we cross things off as we use them, so neither of us goes grocery shopping blind. | React Native · Expo · TypeScript |

### Stack I reach for

```
Mobile    →  React Native (Expo), Kotlin / Jetpack Compose

### Background

- Built products and led strategy across tech and consulting
- CS fundamentals → MBA → back to building
- Learning in public: each project here is a real problem I ran into

*Always open to conversations about product, AI, and whatever I'm building next.*
