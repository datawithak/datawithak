# Hi, I'm Anukriti 👋

CS undergrad + MBA. I work at the intersection of **Technical Product and Strategy** — and I build things on the side to stay close to the code.

Based in **New York City**.

### What I'm building

| Project | What it does | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| [**mamas-kb**](https://github.com/datawithak/mamas-kb) | Turns 19,000 WhatsApp messages from NYC parent groups into a searchable knowledge base | Next.js · TypeScript · Python · Claude AI |
| [**subwayping**](https://github.com/datawithak/subwayping) | One-tap NYC subway arrival tracker — real MTA data, no noise | Kotlin · Android |
| [**keepmehonest-pantry**](https://github.com/datawithak/keepmehonest-pantry) | Shared kitchen inventory app for couples — scan, track, avoid buying things you already have | React Native · Expo · TypeScript |

### Stack I reach for

```
Mobile    →  React Native (Expo), Kotlin / Jetpack Compose
Web       →  Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
Data      →  Python, SQL
AI/LLMs   →  Anthropic Claude, Gemini
```

### Background

- Built products and led strategy across tech and consulting
- CS fundamentals → MBA → back to building
- Learning in public — each project here is a real problem I ran into

*Always open to conversations about product, AI, parenthood, and whatever I'm building next. Maybe you can have it all!*
